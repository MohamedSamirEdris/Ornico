                    LOL, Kidding.
                    I'm not much of a lyricist or anythin'... But I "think" raps should have unity and revolve around some topic instead of throwin' some random lines out there.
                    Nice rap though, just refine it a bit.
                    And again, I don't have to be taken seriously, I'm not one who hangs out in the Freestyle forum.
